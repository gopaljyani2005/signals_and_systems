# Signals and Systems Course Project

About the project.

## Features
- Implementation of Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filters.
- Convolution of filters with input signal to obtain filtered outputs.
- Correlation-based comparison between filtered outputs and given output signal.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone 
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install numpy scipy
```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

```
cd signals_and_systems
```

4. Modify the ```input.txt``` and ```output.txt``` with the input signal and output signal, and then run:

```
python main.py
```
